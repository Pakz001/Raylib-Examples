# Raylib-Examples ( Learn how to code games by studying examples )

My collection of raylib examples. ( https://www.raylib.com/index.html )

For Raylib Version of 4 april 2020 ( Notepad++ windows installer version )

So far every different file in the repo are standalone. GFX and maybe sound wil be included inside the code files as array data.

I might end up storing and creating a few hundred game related code examples in this repo over the next couple of years.

<br>

Points of interest for me and this repo are :

*learning C with Raylib<br>
*Learning more about how Rts/Fps/Rpg/Tbs/Shooter/Action/Puzzle games work.<br>
*Tools for eq. Sprite editing(For direct pasting into code)<br>
*Main focus - Minecraft and Civilization 1/2 style games.<br>

There might be periods where I spend time practising other things like music composition and/or pixelart. Thus there might be a time where I spend less or no time coding. My pixelart blog is : http://pixelart001.blogspot.com/ My music is at : https://soundcloud.com/pakz001

How to use these examples :

Each example in here is a standalone .c file. I myself just copy and paste the one I need into notepad++ and save it as a new .c file and it just works. You should also be able to save this repo as a zip and unzip it and be able to load each example and run it.

Possibly a .h file like raymath.h sometimes is not found, this happens with certain examples in the official examples. You can copy that .h files from the /src files into the folder with the example that needs it. That seemed to have worked for me.

The pico8 inspired sprite and map editor in the spriteeditor folder exports the current image as a c array into the clipboard buffer that can then be pasted inside your code. I use this myself. The 'c' key inside the editor is used for this(in the sprite editor section.) (New version should read 8x8 sprite arrays back into the editor with the 'p' key)(save all(f5)loadall(f6)(tab=switch between spriteview and map view.)
